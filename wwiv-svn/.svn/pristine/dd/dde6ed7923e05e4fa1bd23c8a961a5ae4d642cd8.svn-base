WWIV 5.0 uses all existing files in your 4.3+ install



WWIV.ini:
=========
new features have been added to the WWIV.ini
file that you may need/want to add

EXEC_LOGSYNCFOSS     = [ 1 | 0 ] - If non-zero then WWIVsync.log will 
                         be generated.  The default setting is 1 and this 
                         is currently ignored. 

EXEC_USECWAITFORIDLE = [ 1 | 0 ] - Under WindowsNT/2K/XP when launching 
                         the child process WWIV uses WaitForInputIdle to wait 
                         for the child process to process all normal input 
                         before starting the Fossil handling code.  Setting 
                         this to 0 will disable that (acting like Win9x where 
                         we just wait for a bit (See EXEC_CHILDWAITTIME). 
                         The default value of this is 1. 

EXEC_CHILDWAITTIME   = (time to wait in milliseconds, this parameter is 
                         only used on Win9X unless EXEC_USEWAITFORIDLE is
